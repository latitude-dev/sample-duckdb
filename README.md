## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

`models` - This directory contains the SQL files that define the queries used to fetch data from the database.
`views` - This directory contains the HTML files that define the layout and interface of the application.

Additionally you'll find a `sources.yml` file in the root directory. This file defines the data sources that the project uses. You can add or remove data sources as needed.

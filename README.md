```

After cloning the repository, run the following command to spin up the dev server:
```
latitude dev
```
This will start the server in development mode, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

`models` - This directory contains the SQL files that define the queries used to fetch data from the database.

`views` - This directory contains the HTML files that define the layout and interface of the application.

Additionally you'll find a `sources.yml` file in the root directory. This file defines the data sources that the project uses. You can add or remove data sources as needed.
